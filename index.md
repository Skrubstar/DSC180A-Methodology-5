1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** \
The most intersting thing covered this Quarter for my domain is how the models form to make up a full Earth simulation. The CMIP6 serves as an intricate pattern, 
stitching together several different models prediciting everything from temperature to surface humidity. This has further implications for further predictions as 
it allows us a fine grain access into each feature being predicited for any of our areas of interest.
