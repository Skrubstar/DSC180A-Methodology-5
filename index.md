1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** \
The most intersting thing covered this Quarter for my domain is how the models form to make up a full Earth simulation. The CMIP6 serves as an intricate pattern, 
stitching together several different models prediciting everything from temperature to surface humidity. This has further implications for further predictions as 
it allows us a fine grain access into each feature being predicited for any of our areas of interest. <br> <br>
2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** \
One potential investigation I want to pursure is looking at connecting the climate prediction metrics into something meaningful or understandable. I can say that the
temperature will rise by 2C or that we'll get 3cm less of rainfall, but waht does that actually mean? How does that affect the average day? Or what about crop yield? 
The Quarter 2 potential project seems to invovle connecitng these forecasted numbers into something meaningful and actionable rather than relying on the metrics alone. <br> <br>
3. **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?** \
Read more documentation. I lost some progress by thinking that an xdarray merged differently than how it worked in reality. It's an issue that would've been fixed if
I had actually bothered to read the documentation of a new package rather than assuming it worked like pandas. I'm also guilty of not asking for help as much as I should,
from both mentors and my group. <br> <br>
4. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?** \
I'd be interested in using more evaluation, and prediction metrics. It seems like to connect the raw data into a livability format, we need some way to process and handle the
numbers to convert it into some sort of livability metric that can both be aggregated, as well as have each individual component viewed. Additionally, I'm interested in further
refining a potnetial CNN to see how it would handle and evaluate the climate data to give more accurate predictions as a whole. <br> <br>
